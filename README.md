ResuMate AI is an intelligent resume evaluation system that simulates how Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) screen resumes using NLP and Machine Learning. It provides personalized feedback, keyword match scores, and visual analysis — helping job seekers refine their resumes to match targeted job descriptions and stand out in a competitive job market.

🧠 **Why I Built This**

In today’s job landscape, resumes are often filtered by automated systems before reaching a human. I built ResuMate AI to address this critical gap by creating a smart tool that evaluates resumes the way real ATS systems do. This project helped me strengthen my expertise in NLP, model integration, and user interface design — while solving a real-world problem faced by many job seekers.
